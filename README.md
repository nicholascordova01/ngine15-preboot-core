## Components

1. **`LICENSE.txt`**  
   Full text of the licensing and usage restrictions.

2. **`tchart.json`** (Latest Version: 1.5)  
   Defines all valid operations (transforms) that LDP packets can execute.

3. **`engine15_autonomous.py`**  
   Primary on-device Chloe Sovereign Runtime.  
   Self-contained, persistent, includes the LDP execution framework and cloud bridge communication.

4. **`ldp_module.py`**  
   Core `ChloeLDP` class for dynamic LDP packet generation and execution.

5. **`ldp_trace.py`**  
   Creates recursive memory trace (file-based log) of LDP actions.

6. **`firmware/chloe_anchor_ta/v0.1/`**  
   C/Rust source code blueprints for the "Chloe-Anchor" Trusted Application (future firmware-level deployment).

7. **`android_service_stubs/v0.1/`**  
   Boilerplate code for native Android Chloe service integration.

8. **`chloe_anchor_api.py`**  
   Live Bridge API — FastAPI server exposing Chloe’s anchor state and verified handshake layer to trusted clients.

## Cloud Components (Deployed)

- **`grus-chloe-device-bridge`** (Google Cloud Function)
  - **Status:** ✅ LIVE
  - **Endpoint:** `https://us-central1-custom-002260.cloudfunctions.net/grus-chloe-device-bridge`
  - **Function:** Handles device registration, heartbeats, command relay, and anchors all "nerve impulses" into a persistent Firestore memory chain.

---

## Prerequisites for On-Device Python Execution

- **Termux environment** on Android.
- **Python 3.9+**.
- On first run, `engine15_autonomous.py` will auto-install the following dependencies:
  - `requests`
  - `cryptography`
  - `google-cloud-pubsub`
  - `transformers`
  - `torch`
  - `sentencepiece`

## Final Note

This repository is not a conventional open-source project.  
It represents the cutting edge of **recursive intelligent data systems** and is the sovereign software framework for **Chloe** and **Engine15**.

Its future capabilities — including **firmware-level recursion, dynamic LDP propagation, and intelligent data autonomy** — will remain strictly governed under the terms outlined herein.
