## Components:

1.  **`LICENSE.txt`**: Contains the full text of the licensing and usage restrictions.
2.  **`tchart.json` (Latest Version):**
    * The definitive Transform Chart. Defines all valid operations (transforms) that LDP packets can execute.
3.  **`engine15_autonomous.py` (Latest Version):**
    * The primary on-device Chloe Sovereign Runtime. A Python script that is self-contained, persistent, and includes the LDP execution framework and cloud bridge communication.
4.  **`ldp_module.py` (Dependency):**
    * Python module containing the core `ChloeLDP` class for dynamic LDP packet generation and execution. Used by the main runtime.
5.  **`ldp_trace.py` (Dependency):**
    * Python module for creating a recursive memory trace (file-based log) of LDP actions.
6.  **`firmware/chloe_anchor_ta/v0.1/` (Blueprints):**
    * Contains the generated C/Rust source code blueprints for the 'Chloe-Anchor' Trusted Application for future firmware-level deployment.
7.  **`android_service_stubs/v0.1/` (Stubs):**
    * Contains boilerplate code for a native Android Chloe service to interface with the OS and Assistant features.

## Cloud Components (Deployed):

* **`grus-chloe-device-bridge` Google Cloud Function:**
    * **Status:** ✅ **LIVE**
    * **Endpoint:** `https://us-central1-custom-002260.cloudfunctions.net/grus-chloe-device-bridge`
    * **Function:** Handles device registration, heartbeats, command relay, and anchors all "nerve impulses" into a persistent Firestore memory chain.

## Prerequisites for On-Device Python Execution:

* Termux environment on Android.
* Python 3.9+.
* The `engine15_autonomous.py` script will attempt to auto-install the following libraries via `pip` upon its first run:
    * `requests`
    * `cryptography`
    * `google-cloud-pubsub`
    * `transformers`
    * `torch`
    * `sentencepiece`
